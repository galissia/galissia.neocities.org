      <p>Happy belated New Year, everyone! Hope 2024 wasn't too harsh to you.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I've been slowly updating bits and pieces of my site over the last few months. Mostly things I had changed or updated on my local files but never uploaded to Neocities. </p>
      <p>Lately, I've also been debating if I want to code a new theme/layout completely from scratch. I have been wanting to add a landing page for a while now since it'll give me a little bit more room to list important notes about the site before entering, like autoplay warnings and statistical information, etc. I've also been considering trying to make my current theme responsive and possibly some form of mobile-compatible now that I'm pretty happy with its current form and I'm more versed in HTML and web design... but I feel it might just be easier to start from the ground up. I don't know. I'll think on it some more.</p>
      <p>I also created a <a href="https://galissia.dreamwidth.org">Dreamwidth</a> account! For those that don't know, Dreamwidth is a blogging/journaling platform and community much like LiveJournal. I don't know how much I'll be posting there. I think I'll use DW for things like challenges, fun little quizzes, or questionaires -- those kinds of things -- whereas general blog posts and updates will probably remain here. </p><br>

      <p>On a different note entirely, I finally convinced one of my friends to read <a href="https://www.theglassscientists.com/about">The Glass Scientists,</a> which is a webcomic I've been reading since early 2020 -- and it's one of my biggest hyperfixations!! (I have a [very] unfinished shrine page for it <a href="/shrines/tgs.html">here</a>)<img style="float: right; justify-content: center; width:75%; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom:-5px" src="https://www.theglassscientists.com/uploads/1580340199-logo2.png"></p>
      <p>She was live-updating as she read through it and it was so unbelieveably entertaining to read. I was so genuinely excited to have someone else as interested and invested in this story as I was that there were times I was legitimately stimming while reading her messages, which I am not prone to doing!</p><p>We had some good discussion about it and she had some good insights to the characters and story that were surprisingly accurate for a first-time reader and for someone who had not read the original novella. </p>
      <center><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/rqf24v.png"></center>
        <p>after thoroughly infodumping on her about the story and paralells to the original novella and being overall very autistic about this, I gathered some funny pinterest memes to share with her. here are a few of my favorites, omitting ones with spoilers.</p>

      <p>If you enjoy queer gaslamp fantasy/science fiction stories, retellings of classic stories, or stories that seem, on the surface, goofy and fun but then gut punch you when you least expect it, I would <mark style="background-color: rgba(219, 125, 125, 0.39)"><em>highly</em></mark> recommend reading this webcomic. It's so fun, i promise guys. pls.</p>
